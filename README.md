# TacLink-Sim2Real
Open simulation tool for Large-scale Tactile Sensing Devices, based on SOFA-GAZEBO-GAN framework.

## TO-DO
Run image acquisition module for obtaining tactile image dataset, using ROS/GAZEBO.

1. Move to Catkin workspace (ROS) working directory.

```

$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/sofa_gazebo_interface

```

2. Start Gazebo simulation environment for TacLink.

```

$ roslaunch vitaclink_gazebo vitaclink_world.launch

```
